# Salary & Performance Analysis
## Project Summary

This project analyzes the relationship between NBA player salaries and on-court performance metrics using real-world data. The goal is to evaluate which performance indicators are most strongly associated with player compensation and to demonstrate applied statistical analysis on a realistic dataset.

## What I Did

Cleaned and filtered raw NBA salary and performance data

Performed exploratory data analysis to understand distributions and relationships

Applied statistical tests and modeling to assess salary differences and performance impact

Visualized results and summarized insights in a reproducible HTML report

## Key Insights

Salary distributions are highly skewed, with a small number of players accounting for a large share of total compensation

Certain performance metrics show stronger relationships with salary than others

Salary is influenced by performance, but no single statistic fully explains pay differences

## Tools & Skills

Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing

Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis

Quantitative reasoning and result interpretation

Clear communication of analytical findings
